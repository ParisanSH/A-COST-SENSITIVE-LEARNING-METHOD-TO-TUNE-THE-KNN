# The Implementation of a cost sensetive lerning method to tune the KNN 

In this project, I have been tried to implement new KNN by using the new algorithms, which you can find [A COST-SENSITIVE LEARNING METHOD TO TUNE THE NEAREST NEIGHBOUR FOR INTRUSION DETECTION.pdf](https://github.com/ParisanSH/The-Implementation-of-a-COST-SENSITIVE-LEARNING-METHOD-TO-TUNE-THE-NEAREST-NEIGHBOUR-FOR-INTRUSION-D/files/10328608/A.COST-SENSITIVE.LEARNING.METHOD.TO.TUNE.THE.NEAREST.NEIGHBOUR.FOR.INTRUSION.DETECTION.pdf)
